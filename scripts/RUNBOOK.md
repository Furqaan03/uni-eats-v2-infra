# Uni Eats — Admin Scripts Runbook

Copy-paste commands for adding/removing data and admins. All privileged
scripts use the **Firebase Admin SDK** and bypass Firestore rules by design,
so they need a service-account key. **Project: `uni-eats-v2-aabf5` (production)** —
every command here writes to the real database. There is no separate staging
project; TEST vs LIVE is just a collection-name prefix (see below).

---

## 0. One-time setup (do this first, each new PowerShell window)

PowerShell rejects `&&`, so run these **one line at a time**:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\syedf\Desktop\Furqaan\Uni Eats v2\scripts"
npm install
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\syedf\Downloads\uni-eats-v2-aabf5-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-0247e48acb.json"
```

- `npm install` only needs to be run once (installs `firebase-admin`).
- The `$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` line must be re-run in **every new
  terminal** (it doesn't persist). If a script says "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  is not set", you forgot this line.
- The key file grants **full admin access** — never commit it, never share it.

---

## 1. TEST vs LIVE — what the prefix means

Two environments share one database via a collection-name prefix:

| | TEST (default) | LIVE |
|---|---|---|
| Collections | `orders`, `users`, `vouchers`, … | `live_orders`, `live_users`, `live_vouchers`, … |
| Scripts target it by | (nothing — default) | passing `--live` |
| Dashboard shows it when | toggle = TESTING | toggle = LIVE |

`admins` is shared (never prefixed).

---

## 2. Orders — list / remove

```powershell
# List in-flight orders so you can find the one to remove:
node delete_order.js --list                      # TEST (orders)
node delete_order.js --list --live               # LIVE (live_orders)

# Dry run — prints the order, deletes nothing:
node delete_order.js "#D3296"
node delete_order.js "#D3296" --live

# Actually delete (after checking the dry run):
node delete_order.js "#D3296" --confirm          # from TEST
node delete_order.js "#D3296" --live --confirm   # from LIVE
```

Use the `orderNumber` shown in the app/dashboard (e.g. `#D3296`), not the doc id.
The script refuses to act if two orders share a number.

---

## 3. LIVE seed data — add / remove (for dashboard validation)

```powershell
node seed_live.js            # ADD the 15 sample live_ docs (restaurants/vendors/users/drivers/orders)
node seed_live.js --clean    # REMOVE those same 15 docs
```

`--clean` only removes the specific seed docs (ids `live_o001…`, `live_u001…`, etc.),
not other live data. Re-running the seed is safe (idempotent).

---

## 4. Vouchers / promo codes — add

Edit the `VOUCHERS` list at the top of `seed_vouchers.js`, then:

```powershell
node seed_vouchers.js        # writes vouchers/{code} (TEST env)
```

(Vendors can also create their own codes from the app's Promotions screen.)

---

## 5. Admins — add / promote

```powershell
# 1. Have the person sign in once at the dashboard login (creates their Auth account; will be rejected).
# 2. Grant them a role:
node bootstrap_admin.js someone@example.com super_admin
# Valid roles: super_admin, operations, finance, support, qa  (defaults to super_admin)
```

To **remove/suspend** an admin, use the dashboard's Role & Access page (super-admin only),
or delete the `admins/{uid}` doc in the Firebase console (§7).

---

## 6. User directory backfill (one-off maintenance)

```powershell
node backfill_user_directory.js   # rebuilds userDirectory/{email|universityId} for old accounts
```

Only needed once after the wallet-transfer feature; harmless to re-run.

---

## 7. Removing things from different places

There are three ways to remove data — pick by situation:

1. **Scripts (this folder)** — best for orders and seed data (handles the
   orderNumber→docId lookup and the TEST/LIVE prefix for you). See §2–§3.

2. **Firebase Console** (manual, any collection) —
   <https://console.firebase.google.com/project/uni-eats-v2-aabf5/firestore/data>
   → open a collection (`orders`, `live_orders`, `users`, `admins`, …) → click a
   doc → **⋮ → Delete document** (or **Delete collection** to wipe all docs).
   Use this for one-off deletes the scripts don't cover.

3. **Admin Dashboard UI** (<https://uni-eats-v2-aabf5.web.app>) — doesn't hard-delete,
   but it's the right tool for *operational* changes: block a customer, suspend a
   restaurant/driver, change an admin's role. These write status flags, not deletes.

**Rule of thumb:** orders → script (§2); seed/demo → script (§3); a single stray
doc → console (§7.2); blocking/suspending a live account → dashboard (§7.3).

---

## 8. Dashboard deploy (after editing admin-dashboard/public/index.html)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\syedf\Desktop\Furqaan\Uni Eats v2\admin-dashboard"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Rules / indexes (from repo root):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\syedf\Desktop\Furqaan\Uni Eats v2"
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

---

## 9. Vendor onboarding worker (Spark plan — no Cloud Functions)

The project can't deploy Cloud Functions without Blaze, so the dashboard
queues onboarding actions on the registration docs and this worker performs
the privileged side effects (auth users, claims, magic links, Resend emails):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\syedf\Desktop\Furqaan\Uni Eats v2\scripts"
node onboarding_worker.js              # one pass, TEST env
node onboarding_worker.js --env live   # one pass, LIVE env
node onboarding_worker.js --watch      # keep running, poll every 30s
```

Run it after clicking Invite / Approve / Needs changes / Reject / Resend in
the dashboard (the toast reminds you). Config lives in `scripts/.env`
(gitignored): RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM, SERVICE_ACCOUNT path, etc.

Email caveats until `theunieats.com` is verified at resend.com/domains:
sends only reach the Resend account owner's address (mujtaba.shahid19@gmail.com).
Vendor documents upload to Cloudinary (unsigned preset `vendor_docs` —
create it once: Cloudinary console → Settings → Upload → Add upload preset →
name `vendor_docs`, Signing Mode: Unsigned, folder `vendor-docs`).

When the project upgrades to Blaze: `firebase deploy --only functions,storage`
— the dashboard automatically prefers the callables and the worker retires.
